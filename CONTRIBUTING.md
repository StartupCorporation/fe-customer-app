## Commit Message Format

To maintain a clean and readable Git history, each commit message should include a header, an optional body, and an optional footer.

```
<header>

<body>

<footer>
```

### 1. Commit Message Header

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```
- **type**: Indicates the type of change. Valid values are:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
  - `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
  - `chore`: Other changes that donâ€™t modify src or test files

- **scope**: The module or feature being affected. Scopes vary by repository:
  - **fe-customer-app**: `landing`, `product`, `cart`, `docs`, `infra`
  - **customer-app**: [placeholder for scopes]
  - **fe-admin-app**: [placeholder for scopes]
  - **admin-app**: [placeholder for scopes]
  - **infrastructure**: [placeholder for scopes]
  - **coordinator**: [placeholder for scopes]

- **short summary**: Concisely describe the change in the present tense. Do not capitalize the first word or add a period at the end.

Example:
```
feat(products): add filtering by category
```

### 2. Commit Message Body (Optional)

- The body should be mandatory for all commits except those of type `docs`.
- Must be at least 20 characters long.
- Describe what changed and why in detail.

Example:
```
feat(products): add filtering by category

Added functionality to filter products by category in the product listing page. This improves user experience by allowing users to find desired items faster.
```

### 3. Commit Message Footer (Optional)

- Used for references to issues, breaking changes, or other important notes.
- Example for referencing an issue:
  ```
  Closes #123
  ```
- Example for breaking changes:
  ```
  BREAKING CHANGE: Refactored the API endpoint for product categories. Update API consumers accordingly.
  ```
